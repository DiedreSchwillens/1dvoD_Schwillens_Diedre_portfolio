    <h2>Case introduction: Crooze</h2>

        <p>Crooze is a Flemish radiostation located in Antwerp. Their primary goal is to provide their listeners with
            relaxing background music that will improve their mood and
            reduce stress. They play jazz, soul, funk, chill-hop, lo-fi and more. They avoid interruptions like ads, the
            news or hosts so they can keep the relaxed vibe going. <br> <br>
            Their current design is quite uninspired and doesn't reflect their goals or music, which is why they are
            looking for a rebrand. Our team took on the job with great vigor!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>My contributions</h2>

        <h2> - Sprint 1: Research </h2>
        <p>In the first phase of our project we primarily conducted research. I was tasked to be the scrum master during
            this phase, which was a totally new role for me.
            I was in charge of leading the daily stand-ups and managing our tasks. It was a daunting experience at first
            since I didn't know my team very well like I did in WPL1.
            The research went well: we concluded that our design should aim at both the current Crooze audience (40+)
            and attract a younger crowd as well in order to improve their reach.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2> - Sprint 2: Making decisions </h2>
        <p>We set out with the idea to create a bridge between old and new. I enjoyed making moodboards and
            experimenting with different designs that had a vintage feel to them.
            Niels and I spent most of our time finding the perfect logo together and figuring out the brand colors.
            We ended up with two main ideas that we showed to our group, after which we struggled to come to a mutual
            decision.
            To help us choose, I made posters based on both logos to explore what they both had to offer.
            We ended up picking the logotype I made, and the experimental poster even ended up in the final design.

        <br>
        <h2> - Sprint 3: Applying feedback </h2>
        <p>Now we were finally able to get started on the rest of the branding. I picked modern fonts that complemented
            our visuals. We received some feedback on the design so far, and while
            they liked our poster and presentation, they felt that the website design wasn't totally in line with this.
            The website design
            was a bit too crowded and not as cohesive as our presentation. This was extremely valuable feedback, but it
            did mean we got set back slightly.
            I took on the role of main designer during this phase and redesigned the website to be more like my poster
            and presentation.

        <h2> - Sprint 4: Finishing touches </h2>
        <p>After a lot of hard work, fortunately, my redesign was very well received! Now all I needed to do was create
            a brandbook and other visual extras to finish all of our deliverables. It was very satisfying to see all of our hard work come together.
